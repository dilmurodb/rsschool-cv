## **Summary**

 After studying for 6 years metallurgical engineering at a university and succesfull graduation, I worked in different positions as teacher assistant, helping students to learn highly technical subjects, as english language teacher and mathematics and phisics tutor. However my passion for learning new skills led me to a different career path. In 2020 I have decided to start a new jurney into web development and enrolled in Software Engineering Immersive Course, where I learned the fundamentals of programming. I found that front-end technologies such as JavaScript and ReactJS are my favorite coding languages. After completing the course I have been working on my personal websites and occasional freelance projects to build front-end web applications and worked for international analytical company. Although my experience working for the analytical company as web application developer is less then a year, I have gained valuable skills working with a team of developers and learned how to collaborate in order to achieve great results. I am excellent problem solver, communicative, adabtable and with great attention to detail which allows me to bring outstanding results for any development team.
